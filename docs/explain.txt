Part one:
-> K3s and Vagrant:
	Lightweight Kubernetes. Easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary of less than 100 MB.
Great for:
    Edge
    IoT
    CI*
    Development*
    ARM
    Embedding K8s
    Situations where a PhD in K8s clusterology is infeasible
Operation of all Kubernetes control plane components is encapsulated in a single binary and process. This allows K3s to automate and manage complex cluster operations like distributing certificates.
